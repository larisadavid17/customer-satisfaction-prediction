Conclusion of the project
Following the analysis presented above, the Gini parameter tree method will be used to answer the set of research questions. 

For the first questions "Is there any relationship between customer data (Gender, Customer Type, Age, Flight distance) and satisfaction?" and "If yes, how strong is the link?", the importance of the attributes was analyzed. The most Important attributes were in order: Online boarding, Seat comfort, Type of travel, Class, Cleanliness, Age group and Food and drink. Thus, most of the important attributes are related to the services provided. The exception is the attribute Age group which shows an influence of age group on satisfaction. However, it can be said that the most important aspects in determining customer satisfaction are service-related aspects, while personal data has less influence. 

The last question "Is it possible to estimate whether or not the customer will be satisfied, taking into account the customer's opinion of the airline's service?" has a positive answer. It will be possible to estimate customer satisfaction on the basis of opinions about the services provided by the airline. The estimate will be accurate and it will be possible to detect particularly dissatisfied customers so that remedial actioncan be attempted. 

In conclusion, the analysis yielded positive results in relation to the proposed research questions. Thus, the chosen method can provide a reliable prediction for managing customer satisfaction in airline.
